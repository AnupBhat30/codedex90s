      <h2>1. Introduction to the 90s Internet</h2>
      <p>
        The 1990s marked the beginning of the World Wide Web as we know it
        today. It was a time of exploration and innovation, where users began to
        connect to the internet from their homes.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this decade, the internet transformed from a niche tool used by
        researchers to a mainstream platform for communication, information, and
        entertainment.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="course-content">
      <h2>2. Dial-Up Connections</h2>
      <p>
        Dial-up connections were the primary means of accessing the internet in
        the 90s. Users would connect their computers to a phone line using a
        modem, which made a series of beeping sounds as it established a
        connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        While slow by today’s standards, dial-up was revolutionary at the time,
        allowing users to browse websites, send emails, and chat online.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="course-content">
      <h2>3. Popular Browsers of the Era</h2>
      <p>
        Several web browsers emerged during the 90s, each contributing to the
        growth of the internet:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Netscape Navigator:</strong> One of the first popular web
          browsers, known for its user-friendly interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Internet Explorer:</strong> Released by Microsoft, it quickly
          became the dominant browser in the late 90s.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Opera:</strong> A lesser-known browser that introduced
          features like tabbed browsing.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="course-content">
      <h2>4. Basic HTML and Web Design</h2>
      <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was the backbone of web design in the
        90s. It allowed users to create simple web pages with text, images, and
        links.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning basic HTML was essential for anyone looking to build a presence
        on the web. Simple tags like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for headings and
        <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for links were commonly used.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="course-content">
      <h2>5. Online Communities and Culture</h2>
      <p>
        The 90s saw the rise of online communities, where users could connect
        with others who shared similar interests. Forums, chat rooms, and early
        social media platforms like AOL Instant Messenger became popular.
      </p>
      <p>
        These communities fostered a sense of belonging and allowed users to
        share ideas, experiences, and creativity.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="course-content">
      <h2>6. Safety and Etiquette</h2>
      <p>
        As the internet grew, so did the importance of online safety and
        etiquette. Users were encouraged to protect their personal information
        and be respectful in online interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding the unwritten rules of online communication was crucial
        for navigating the early web.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="course-content">
      <h2>7. Final Project: Create a 90s Style Web Page!</h2>
      <p>
        For your final project, create a simple web page using basic HTML.
        Incorporate elements that reflect the 90s internet culture, such as
        bright colors, animated GIFs, and retro fonts.
